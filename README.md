This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a complete offline voice assistant. Below is a detailed explanation of the code and its functionality:

### Overview
The voice assistant is designed to:
1. Record audio input from the user.
2. Transcribe the recorded audio into text using a speech-to-text (STT) model.
3. Generate a response using an AI model.
4. Convert the response into speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) engine.

### Key Components
1. **Audio Configuration**:
    - The assistant uses the `pyaudio` library to capture audio input.
    - Audio settings such as chunk size, format, channels, and rate are configured for optimal performance.

2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**:
    - The `faster-whisper` library is used to transcribe audio into text.
    - The assistant saves the recorded audio as a temporary `.wav` file for processing.

3. **AI Response Generation**:
    - The `ollama` library is used to interact with an AI model (e.g., `mistral`) to generate responses based on the transcribed text.

4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
    - The `pyttsx3` library is used to convert the AI-generated response into speech, allowing the assistant to "speak" back to the user.

### Workflow
1. **Initialization**:
    - The `OfflineAssistant` class initializes the audio configuration, loads the STT and TTS models, and prepares the audio stream for recording.

2. **Recording Audio**:
    - The `record_voice` method captures audio input until a period of silence is detected. This ensures the assistant stops recording when the user finishes speaking.

3. **Transcription**:
    - The `transcribe` method processes the recorded audio and converts it into text using the Whisper model.

4. **Generating a Response**:
    - The `respond` method sends the transcribed text to the AI model and retrieves a response. If the user says commands like "exit" or "quit," the assistant terminates.

5. **Speaking the Response**:
    - The assistant uses the TTS engine to vocalize the AI-generated response.

6. **Running the Assistant**:
    - The `run` method orchestrates the entire workflow in a loop, allowing continuous interaction until the user decides to exit.

### Usage
- The assistant is instantiated as the `assistant` variable and can be started by calling the `run` method.
- To stop the assistant, simply say "exit," "quit," or "bye."

This implementation provides a robust offline voice assistant capable of handling basic interactions without requiring an internet connection for STT or TTS functionalities.
